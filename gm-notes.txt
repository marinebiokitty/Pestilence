Casting notes

Alexander should not be played by someone uncomfortable with self-harm. 

Victor(ia) should not be played by someone who is uncomfortable with suicidal characters.

N. Saburov is preferably played by an experienced player, or a player who can aggressively insert themselves into the action. They start with no strong alliances and they will make the most impact by getting up in people's faces and taking risks. 

*****************
Location Notes

The common room (where all the NPCs are) is highly recommended to be a T-shaped hallway or at least a room with big hidden corners. This will allow Dr. Filin to stealth-kill an NPC for his notebook or Klara/Katerina to stealth-kill Victoria if she wanders off to heal people on her own. (Thanks for the note, David!)

The NPCs should be as far apart from each other as possible, some preferably tucked in remote corners.

Player suggestion: A couple of players wanted the Kains to start in the same room apart from the rest of the group so they could yell at each other a bit before other people barge in. If this is desireable, the Kains can start in the garden while the rest start in the common room. Elder Kain's room should always be free of players at game start (so it can get looted).

*****************
Runtime Notes

There should be 13 characters (7 PCs and 6 NPCs) at start of game. If bodies are burned, remove the sheet/badge from game space.

The army will arrive in the last five minutes of game only if more than half the living characters appear uninfected.

The game may end early if 1) the ritual sacrifice is completed successfully and Klara leaves the game space and 2) no one is infected or none of Dr. Filin/Victoria, Alexander/Nikolai, Dr. Filin/Nikolai pairs are intact.

***
Non-explicit but creative counter to Elder Kain's abilities that came up in the red run: 

Vitaliy/Katerina is more spiritually powerful than Elder Kain (mentioned briefly in their character sheets). As such, if Vitaliy/Katerina completes the Craft Body ritual before Elder Kain completes Entrapment, the earth spirit is pulled from Elder Kain's grasp and respawns with a new body by the clay mound. 

Alexander's Entrapment, on the other hand, can only be interrupted directly. Elder Kain didn't get infected to in order to get his Entrapment ability.

Notes from last run

A bit unexpectedly, Alexander had the hardest time progressing with his notebook in both runs. Not sure if it's because Elder Kain wanted to gently discourage his kid's interest in magic or because the Kains didn't pay attention to Alexander (as usual). I had suggestions to nerf the "witness 3 magic tricks" down to 2 or 1, but I decided against it since 1) the notebook is non-essential unless Elder Kain is killed, a somewhat unlikely event before late game, 2) Alexander really just needs his family's love. If Elder Kain decides to screw tradition and make his non-magic kid the heir, Alexander can use his local knowledge and outside education to modernize the town without pissing off the locals too fast and too much. He appeases the earth by protecting it and heals his people by having well-stocked medical centers.
