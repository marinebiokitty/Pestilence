%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover produces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.
