%% This file sets up the Mem, MemFold, and MemEnvelope datatypes, and
%% creates possible macros for each.
%%
%% The Mem datatype isn't really used directly; it's there so the
%% other datatypes can inherit and share its code.

%% MemFold and MemEnvelope are both subtypes of Mem.  MemFold is for
%% fold-n-staple style mempackets, MemEnvelope is for stuff-n-seal
%% style mempackets.  If you want a mempacket to contain interesting
%% contents, like sheets, abilities, and other mempackets, use a
%% MemEnvelope.

%%%%%
%% MemCover and MemPage are for the cover and pages of mempacket
%% booklets, which resemble research notebooks.  These are good
%% substitutes for large piles of MemFolds, and can be useful for
%% things like amnesiac characters.
%%
%% Like MemFolds, MemPages shouldn't directly own any other elements
%% as contents.  Use MemEnvelope instead.
%%
%% MemPages are usually assigned to a MemCover (via \MYmems), with the
%% MemCover representing the entire booklet and assigned to a
%% character.
%%
%% A MemCover is not a mempacket in and of itself; its name is not its
%% trigger and its text is not a memory.

%% \startmembook...\endmembook is a simple wrapper around \memcover
%% that may have better syntax for use within character sheets (inside
