Test Subject to Food to Servant

Born to a simple family of farmers on Earth, you took part in a survey about where they took some of your blood. Next thing you know your parents 
are being offered a "generous payment" for the right to make you a "ward of the state" in the name of the greater good. You are being sent to a place with white walls and many needles. You meet \cSpite{}  here, as one of the many white clad figures with needles that are constantly taking from you bit by bit, instant by instant, drop by drop. There is a crashing, next thing you know you are being taken somewhere alongside \cSpite{}.
