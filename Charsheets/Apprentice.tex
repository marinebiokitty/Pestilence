\name{\cApprentice{}}

You were a disappointment the moment you were born. An elder traditionally bore one child to pass on their powers to and focused the rest of their attention on their duty. Unfortunately, despite your powerful parents, you barely had enough spiritual power to be distinguishable from a patch of cow hide. Your \cElder{\parent} could not pass on \cElder{\their} powers to you, and consequently, \cRebel{} had to come into existence.

You liked \cRebel{} when \cRebel{\they} was a child. \cRebel{\They} looked up to you and listened to you, and you humored \cRebel{\them} by playing \cRebel{\their} odd games or helping with \cRebel{\their} schoolwork. You miss those simpler times sometimes. All is past, however. \cRebel{} is now an annoying little brat who constantly talks about how morally superior \cRebel{\they} is to everyone in town. No wonder \cRebel{\they} gets along so well with the big-headed new city doctor. You wouldn't have minded the relationship too much if \cRebel acted \cRebel{\their} age and knew \cRebel{\their} duties. Instead, \cRebel{\they} spends day and night with the outsider doctor, blissfully unaware that the doctor is using \cRebel{\them} to pry at your family's secrets. That was the entire reason the doctor came to your town. \cOutsider{\They} had been asking around town about your \cElder{\parent} and your family's magic from the beginning. Did \cRebel{} not notice that? Was \cRebel{\they} so besotted that \cRebel{\they} couldn't see past such simple, obvious manipulation?

You worry about \cRebel{} too much nowadays. You've tried talking to \cRebel{\them}, and when reason failed, you threatened to kill that manipulative little doctor in frustration. \cRebel{} never quite forgave you for that. \cRebel{\They} is still cold towards you, even when faced with more pressing issues than \cRebel{\their} ill-advised romance.

Ah, yes, the pressing issues. The plague. You're not sure where it came from. It's unlike anything you've ever studied in the two years you've been away from town. You suspect it is a hemorrhagic fever caused by an errant earth spirit. \cElder{\Parent} has always been reluctant to offer sacrifices to the earth, and you admire \cElder{\them} for that. You've heard that \cElder{\they} eradicated an age-old barbaric tradition of human sacrifice by binding the earth's energy somehow. \cRebel{} thinks it's slavery, but that just makes you roll your eyes. What's the comfort of some vague earth creature next to human lives? You've never heard those spirits they talk so often about anyways. As far as you're concerned, they're units of energy, like heat. You don't worry about the plight of your radiator. 

Of course, the metaphorical radiator is malfunctioning now, and you'll have to fix it. \cElder{\Parent} seems to have lost control of the earth somehow and is either unwilling or unable to regain it. You're not the one to take any joy in the deaths of thousands, but you have to admit it presents an opportunity to prove yourself. You're still somewhat bitter that \cElder{\Parent} refuses to trust you with \cElder{\their} secrets, preferring to spout off some excuse about sacrifices and burden. You never understood what that was about. You don't want to marry--you never loved anyone with the kind of raging passion that \cRebel{} is capable of--and \cElder{\Parent} already has a way of making miracles without appeasing the hungry earth. So what was the problem? You could only conclude that \cElder{\Parent} is embarrassed of you. You were born unworthy and you are still unworthy in your \cElder{\parent}'s eyes.

It matters little now. You will find a way to recapture the earth and contain the plague. You will replicate your \cElder{\parent}'s research and show him that birthright and gifts are nothing next to hard work and intellect. Your \cElder{\parent} never taught you much \cElder{\themself}, but you've travelled the world on your own, studying mysticism, medicine and even a little synthetic chemistry. The ability to create cures greater than nature's own excited you, and unlike the spirit world, synthetic chemistry returned your love in ample amounts. But alas, you have a legacy to bear and you just can't leave it at the hands of your irresponsible \cRebel{\sibling}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Stop the plague
	\item Recapture the escaped earth spirit before your \cElder{\parent} does
	\item Find out how the earth spirit broke free in the first place
	\item Protect \cRebel{}, especially from that manipulative, snake-eyed doctor. Idiot or not, \cRebel{} is still family.
	\item Keep your family's magical secrets from being revealed to the outside world
	\item Be named as your \cElder{\parent}'s successor
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You have very low tolerance for alcohol. Drinking booze will cause you to lose 1 CR for half an hour. The effect is stackable.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cElder{}} Your \cElder{\parent}. A tough \cElder{\human} to please.
	\contact{\cRebel{}} Your feckless \cRebel{\sibling}. You do love \cRebel{\them}, though \cRebel{\they} makes it very difficult at times
	\contact{\cOutsider{}} The snake who has your \cRebel{\sibling} wrapped around \cOutsider{\their} little finger 
	\contact{\cCon{}} A childhood friend of yours. You're glad to see \cCon{\them} alive, but you wonder what has become of \cCon{\them} since you left  
\end{contacts}
