Such a lovely tapestry of pain! 
You came from a lower family on the Ver homeworld with the bare minimum of support or schooling. You managed to score high enough
on the Imperial Entrance Exam to earn a spot in the Imperial Naval Engineering School under contract with the Navy. You worked
hard, bringing home passing marks, though catching a few demerits for lack of impulse control. After graduating you were facing 
several hundred years of worthless work in the Navy patrolling empty space, when you received the offer of a position on 
The Imperial Ship Chivalry, a trading vessel that operates under direct Imperial Charter. These vessels are fairly rare, requiring
the patronage of one of the High Families, close friends of the Imperial Throne, known for leaving Imperial space and bringing
back valuable goods direclty to the throne! A bit more importantly the Chartered vessels do not run under standard Imperial regulations.
Thus you are the Chief Engineer of The Imperial Ship Chivalry.
