Such a lovely tapestry of control! 
You came from a lower family on the Ver homeworld with the bare minimum of support or schooling. You managed to score high enough on the Imperial Entrance Exam to earn a spot in the Imperial Naval Engineering School under contract with the Navy. You worked hard, bringing home passing marks, though catching a few demerits for lack of impulse control. After graduating you were facing  several hundred years of worthless work in the Navy patrolling empty space, when you received the offer of a position on The Imperial Ship Chivalry, a trading vessel that operates under direct Imperial Charter. These vessels are fairly rare, requiring the patronage of one of the High Families, close friends of the Imperial Throne, known for leaving Imperial space and bringing back valuable goods directly to the throne! A bit more importantly the Chartered vessels do not run under standard Imperial regulations. Thus you are the Chief Engineer of The Imperial Ship Chivalry. 

As you have gotten to know your captain, or rather \cVone{\Duke} as they prefer, you have noticed that they are far in excess of the normal eccentricities expected of a chartered trader, but that works out rather well for you. You can play as though you were a member of Her Imperial Majesty's court since it seem to let you get away with some indiscretions here and there when dealing with the cargo. So long as it is not lethal to the little animals. 

Recently the ship lost it's Chief Intelligence Officer, the one to put it bluntly who was in charge of the bribes. The captain took over their information, but leaves the actual payments of the bribes to you. Something you find quite agreeable as it gives you a chance to line your pockets a bit more, a little skimming never hurts.

After years in \cVone{\their} service you had given up on finding better was to exercise your desires when one of the few pets of your captain caught your attention. Seeing  \cJulie{} in action was simply marvelous, you have to have \cJulie{\them}, the ability to fight so well, the drive, the sheer life you see. Even here on a ship far from home \cJulie{\they} are full of fire. You have attempted to court her secretly, the captain is very protective of \cVone{their} pets, and at first she spurned you, which only made you want her more. Now though, you have made your serious intent clear, you are not seeing her as a toy, but someone that you wish to turn into a fellow Ver. Your dare say it love, seems to be being returned. \cJulie{} only needs to be drained and given your blood once more inorder to be a full Ver. Then she will be able to witness a truly new word of sensation that you want to gift to her.

What, there is a Frith ship, but, you spent some of the bribe money at your last port, hmmmm, perhaps you can scrounge up some from the rest of the crew, the Captain pays them to keep the books clean....
