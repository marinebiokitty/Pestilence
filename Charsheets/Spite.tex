\begin{itemz}[Backstory]
    \item A noted modern human biomedical researcher who has discovered that there is something interesting about his subject (\cPlead{})'s blood.
    \item When little, parents were lured by the promise of extended lifespan. Volunteered to join the Ver as ghouls, abandoning \cSpite{} as well as their lives on Earth. However, as soon as they left human space, they were turned into blood puppets: brain-dead sources of human blood, a delicacy for the Ver.
    \item Vowed to do everything he/she could to bring down the Ver. Became an eminent biomedical researcher. Recruited to join a covert anti-Ver government organization.
    \item Hates Ver with a passion and would rather kill everyone on board, including him/herself, rather than be turned.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Destroy Ver, even at great personal sacrifice and collateral damage if necessary. Maybe sabotage engines?
	\item Failing that, survive and get back to Earth.
	\item Present current work to \cVone{} by the time limit.
	\item Discover what is strange about \cPlead{}'s blood.
	\item Get a look at Ver cloaking technology.
	\item Get a look at Frith secret technology.
