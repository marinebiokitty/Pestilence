\begin{itemz}[Backstory]
    \item A renowned modern human biomedical researcher. Cured leukemia. Ostensibly an academic researcher, but also part of a covert government anti-Ver organization.
    \item While conducting a study analyzing routine blood samples, discovered extraordinary properties in \cPlead{}'s blood. Managed to get \cPlead{} abducted for further study.
    \item When little, parents were lured by the promise of extended lifespan. Volunteered to join the Ver as ghouls, abandoning \cSpite{} as well as their lives on Earth. However, as soon as they left human space, they were turned into blood puppets: brain-dead sources of human blood, a delicacy for the Ver.
    \item Vowed to do everything he/she could to bring down the Ver. Became an eminent biomedical researcher. Recruited to join a covert anti-Ver government organization.
    \item Hates Ver with a passion and would rather kill everyone on board, including him/herself, rather than be turned.
