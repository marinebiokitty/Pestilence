\begin{itemz}[Backstory]
    \item A noted modern human biomedical researcher who has discovered that there is something interesting about his subject (\cPlead{})'s blood.
    \item When little, parents were lured by the promise of eternal life. Volunteered to join the Ver as ghouls, abandoning \cSpite{} as well as their lives on Earth. However, as soon as they left human space, they were turned into blood puppets: brain-dead sources of human blood, which is a delicacy for the Ver.
    \item Vowed to do everything he/she could to bring down the Ver. Became an eminent biomedical researcher. Recruited to join a covert anti-Ver government organization.
    \item Hates Ver with a passion and would rather kill everyone on board, including him/herself, rather than be turned.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Destroy Ver, at the cost of personal sacrifice if necessary.
	\item Present current work to \cVone{} by the time limit.
	\item Discover what is strange about \cPlead{}'s blood.
