You grew up surrounded by books. Your parents were successful agricultural biology researchers, and the walls of your home were always lined with dusty shelves and filing cabinets. Every few years, your family would pick up and move to yet another rural college town in the middle of nowhere. You hated it every time. You didn't care if {\bf this} new town was home to a prestigious agricultural research institute; all you knew was that you were going to be the new kid in school, yet again. Moving always meant starting over with no friends, and gradually losing touch with the few friends you had just barely made. Other than your parents, whom you grew very close to, the only constant in your repeatedly-uprooted childhood was the growing library of books that they could never bear to get rid of. So, you immersed yourself in reading them. You had no choice; there was nothing else to do.

But these were't ordinary children's books. Normally, plant microbiology textbooks would make for dry first-grade reading, but you found them fascinating. Your parents were only too happy to feed and nurture your budding interests. Soon, your room was full of exotic plants and gurgling hydroponics systems: your testbed for trying to create new breeds, and investigating why certain combinations failed. You didn't need to have the scientific method taught to you in a classroom; it was just common sense. If you couldn't find an answer to something that you were curious about, you designed and carried out your own experiments. You won national science fairs and scholarships to colleges that you had never even heard of. By the time you finished junior high, universities were begging you to skip years of high school coursework to enroll early. 

Then, one day, your parents never came home. You remember it vividly -- you were 14, it was a Sunday, and you were packing for college. They had gone to church, which was something that they thankfully spared you from, and night fell without a word from them. Calls went unanswered. The police were unhelpful. It was only 24 hours later that the missing persons investigation could begin in earnest. The search was called off a month later. The church that your parents had told you about had never existed. Their case was never solved.

But you weren't one to take ``I don't know" for an answer. You leveraged your considerable intellect, public sympathy, and family friends. You wouldn't give up. Someone had to know {\bf something}. Eventually, one of your parents' colleagues cracked, perhaps taking pity on you, or perhaps feeling that you had a right to know. They explained that your parents had been involved with a cult of Ver-worshippers called the Blood Pact. On that fateful Sunday, every last member of the Blood Pact had disappeared. Investigators uncovered encrypted communications between the Blood Pact and the Ver, showing that the Ver had promised their human followers eternal life if they would board one of their ships and pledge their service to them. Your parents were on the list.

Somehow, you moved on. You grew to hate your parents -- for never telling you the truth, for not even saying goodbye. And by extension, you also hated the Ver, for taking them away from you. Immersing yourself in your studies, you became a successful biomedical researcher in your own right. You cured leukemia and became a tenured professor by 25. But despite your successes, you were never happy. Everything had changed that day, and nothing could ever make it right.

One day, you received a message from an unidentified sender. All it said was ``Talk to us if you want to do something about the Ver." Of course, you responded. It turns out that you weren't the only one who hated the Ver. There was a shadow organization, as well-funded as they were cryptic, who saw the Ver as an existential threat to all of humanity, and were looking for ways to prepare for inevitable all-out war against them. Their mission was to counteract the Ver threat by any means necessary. ``By any means necessary." The words seemed to burn on your display, like fire. And the kicker -- they wanted you to work for them.

You continued your hematological research, this time with the considerable resources of the shadowy anti-Ver organization at your disposal. While reviewing the results of a massive blood collection survey study, you discovered that one subject's blood exhibited remarkable properties. You were able to convey the importance of this particular person, \cPlead{\MYname}, to your patrons, who managed to ``procure" \cPlead{him} for your studies. The details of how they accomplished this are unknown to you, and from past experience dealing with your patron organization, you think that might be for the best.

But then it all went wrong. The Ver found out about the opposition group, and launched a surprise raid against your hidden base. They captured you and your research subject, and now you're both locked aboard a Ver ship bound for Ver space. Worse, one of your Ver captors, \cVone{}, wants to turn you into a ghoul and add you to his collection. You can't even begin to imagine what unspeakable horrors await you, but the crew seems to be distracted by a Frith ship hailing them. Now's your chance to try to get free. If you can manage that, maybe you can do something about your situation...and maybe even try to make things right.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find out more about the Blood Pact. Who are the Ver involved, and what happened to your parents?
