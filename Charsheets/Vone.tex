Come here my pretty little pets.

You are one of the Ver, a race that has been travelling the stars for many thousands of years. You were born into a very 
wealthy family, taught from a young age how to conduct business, negotiate deals, and generally slide smoothly through the
worlds. Your family has long conducted trade under Imperial Charter, thus given the privilege of travelling freely through
Ver space, as well as the rights to leave Ver space at will. As a part of this privilege you are required to share a larger 
part of your profits with the Imperial Throne than other merchants, though the fact that you are a sanctioned Imperial Ship 
has saved your ship on more than one occasion, as any illegal search and seizure would bring the might of the Imperium to 
investigate. You were gifted your current ship The Imperial Ship Chivalry upon signing the life long contract of supplying 
the Empress's court with fresh supplies of the delicacy that is kine blood. A duty you have been faithfully fulfilling for
the last several thousand years. Though the expansion of kineity from their home world and their treaties with the neighboring
Frith have made procurement of fresh blood become limited to "blood packs", no where near as good as from the source.
Still, with these new restrictions, you have found your self able to steal away with a few hundred live ones in stasis 
that will bring much reward when you are able to bring them home. 

Over the years you have found yourself fascinated with the kine's behaviours namely a time that they refer to as the 
Victorian Age.
