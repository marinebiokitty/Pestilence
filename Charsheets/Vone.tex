\textit{Come here my pretty little pets.}

You are one of the Ver, a race that has been traveling the stars for many thousands of years. You were born into a very wealthy family, taught from a young age how to conduct business, negotiate deals, and generally slide smoothly through the worlds. Your family has long conducted trade under Imperial Charter, which gives them the privilege of traveling freely through Ver space, as well as the right to leave Ver space at will. As a part of this privilege, you are required to share a larger part of your profits with the Imperial Throne than other merchants. This inconvenience is offset by the fact that you are a sanctioned Imperial Ship, which has saved your ship on more than one occasion; any illegal search and seizure would summon the might of the Imperium to investigate. You were gifted your current ship, The Imperial Ship Chivalry, upon signing a life-long contract to supply the Empress's court with fresh supplies of the delicacy that is kine blood. You discovered the kine homeworld when the kine were naught but crude hunter-gatherers, and were given a monopoly over the supply of kine blood. No other Ver may intrude upon the supply of kine so long as you continue to deliver, which is a duty that you have been faithfully fulfilling for the last several thousand years. You watched as the kine developed from primitive tool-users to beings that may actually be worth recognition. 

The kine even managed to create a rather quaint recreation of the Empress's court during what they refer to as the Victorian age. It bore such a striking resemblance that you decided it would be entertaining to rename your ship officers' titles to mirror their so-called nobility. Your officers have gone with this, perhaps thinking you are eccentric, but no more than they themselves are. In fact, you have found it rewarding course to take those officers who are competent, but rejected by others for having quirks. You have built a reputation for being accepting of those whom others curse for being weird, and in exchange have found a loyal cadre of officers.\cVtwo{} is a very good engineer, but is someone who has such a poor ability to deny sudden urges, as well as an odd fascination with pain. Someone who graduated from the Naval School, but would have barely survived the indebted years of service to the Navy. Though you do need to keep and eye on them as far as your pets are concerned, for \cVtwo{} is not good at hold back with punishments. \cVthree{} is a great medical officer, with their quirks being a fascination with the study of blood. You tolerate their studies since those studies may in fact lead to a profit at some point, and if not, they are not an especially costly diversion for an officer to have. You had a great intelligence officer, unfortunately lost in the last raid due to a misunderstanding, now you need a new one, someone who you can trust to ferret out secrets and help keep the ship running, certainly not a simple ghoul, you doubt the officers would stand for going that far.

As far as your crew, you found a way to turn your own fascination with the kine into a way to keep your ship running smoothly. Every so often you find a member of the kine that amuses you especially, something they do, or are raises them above their kin. Such as \cJoan{} for instance, such a lovely little flower of zealotry, thinking that this is \cJoan{\their} personal Hell that they must suffer and serve through. Considering the whole attempted burning at the stake business you can understand the misunderstanding. These special kine deserve to be preserved as your pets, kept both alive and loyal with offers of you blood, without which they would soon age and die. That you do give them a minor wage in credits serves more to keep the books clean for the Frith.

Now the kine have expanded into an interstellar power, brokering treaties with the Frith. Even worse your enemies in the court back home managed to convince the Empress to sign into a treaty forcing the respecting of each race's laws while in their space. Some of the Ver wish to both destroy the power of your family and create a war with the humans the would lead to their complete subjugation and taming as a source of blood for all. They are fools. You have studied the kine long enough to know that such a war would simply lead to the extinction of the kine, they barely tolerate being ruled by each other. They would as a race commit suicide before being brought to heel. However with the treaties you still have the Kine legal trade in blood packs. Blood, that even when stale is more delicious than any other found so far, some even say addicting. 

Thankfully you have been able to find kine over the years who would sell their kine for money, power, or even promises of life eternal, which your blood can give. Some very few have allowed your ship to sneak onto Earth itself and raid several hundred kine to take back to the Empress. They get to have an excuse to tighten their control of their fellows with you as the big bad, and you get the reward. You even managed to get a hold of \cSpite{} someone who managed to cure cancer of the blood, how lovely, though they seem to be very resistant to the deal that the rest of the crew enjoys. No matter you have time.

Wait, what, you have reports of a Frith customs ship hailing. They were supposed to catch us after we managed to drop off the cargo. \cCbad{} must be getting greedy, or just impatient. Well \cVtwo{} knows to give \cCbad{\them} the money agreed upon.
