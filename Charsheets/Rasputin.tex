You were born in 1869 on the vast plains of Western Siberia to a well-to-do peasant family. You were the fifth of nine children, all of whom died but you and your sister Feodosiya. The townspeople never accepted you. In fact, they instinctively feared you and your unusual gifts. You've always been abnormally strong and healthy, healing much more quickly than an ordinary person, and you've always had a taste for red meat, the bloodier the better. When you were 18 years old you married and had three children, but the married life never suited you. You wanted something more. In 1892 you left your family to spend time in a monastery, where you became a fervent believer in Russian Orthodoxy. You became convinced that you must give up consuming meat and alcohol, which weakened you, but your religious fervor covered this up. Eventually you became a wandering religious mystic. Hundreds came from all around to hear your interpretations of the scriptures. Always you sought knowledge, and eventually you sought it beyond the walls of Orthodoxy. In your travels you discovered the cult of Yug-Sothoth.

At first you were hesitant to worship a deity other than the Christian God, but when you petitioned Yug-Sothoth for knowledge with a gift of blood, you received the answers that you had always been looking for. You heard a voice telling you the secret of your powers. The one you called father was not your true father, but in fact your father was a member of a vampiric race from a distant star known as the Ver. You learned that you would be strengthened again if you were to consume red meat and blood, and you began doing this again in secret and regained the strength of your youth.

Around this time you were able to use your charm and influence to gain audience before the House of Romanov. The Romanovs were embroiled in dealing with the revolution, and the apparent weakness of the Tsaesarevich Alexei, the Tsar's son, only contributed to their problems. So you were taken on as healer to Alexei, who had hemophilia, a disorder of the blood that made him bleed profusely if injured. You gave sacrifice to Yug-Sothoth to gain healing knowledge to ease Alexei's suffering, which sealed your bond with the Tsarina, despite the hatred directed towards you from outside the palace after an initial fascination with your powers. The people were just like the ignorant peasants in your hometown, fearing what they did not understand. Ignorance makes animals of men, and you want to avoid ignorance at all costs. They tried to kill you more than once, and the last time they nearly managed it.

In 1916, the nobleman Felix Yusupov invited you to his palace, where he tried to poison you. He got you drunk and shot you multiple times. Strengthened by the red meat you ate in secret, this did not kill you. You made your way outside, only for one of Yusupov's conspirators to shoot you even more. Still you lived. Thinking you dead, the men wrapped your body in a cloth and dumped it into a hole in the ice above a nearby river. You have few memories of this time, during which you were scooped from the water and revived by the Ver, who left behind a copy of your form to convince those who sought to kill you of your death.

You woke up aboard the TIS Chivalry, a Veran merchant vessel, where \cVone{} fed you a glass of his blood, binding you to be his slave, dependent on his blood for your continued survival
