\name{\cRasputin{}}

You were born in 1869 on the vast plains of Western Siberia to a well-to-do peasant family. You were the fifth of nine children, all of whom died but you and your sister Feodosiya. The townspeople never accepted you. In fact, they instinctively feared you and your unusual gifts. You've always been abnormally strong and healthy, healing much more quickly than an ordinary person, and you've always had a taste for red meat, the bloodier the better. When you were 18 years old you married and had three children, but the married life never suited you. You wanted something more. In 1892 you left your family to spend time in a monastery, where you became a fervent believer in Russian Orthodoxy. You became convinced that you must give up consuming meat and alcohol, which weakened you, but your religious fervor covered this up. Eventually you became a wandering religious mystic. Hundreds came from all around to hear your interpretations of the scriptures. Always you sought knowledge, and eventually you sought it beyond the walls of Orthodoxy. In your travels you discovered the cult of Yug-Sothoth.

At first you were hesitant to worship a deity other than the Christian God, but when you petitioned Yug-Sothoth for knowledge with a gift of blood, you received the answers that you had always been looking for. You heard a voice telling you the secret of your powers. The one you called father was not your true father, but in fact
