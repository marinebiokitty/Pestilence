The earth spirit, sometimes called a shabnak-adyr, is a prominent figure in local lore. Outsiders would call it a devil, but to the locals, it is a thousand year old protector. Born from the earth's core, a shabnak-adyr prefers to sleep in the soil where it was born. Life always circles around its home. Its hair grows as harvest, and its breath turns a newborn's lips pink and their blood warm. 

Because all blood is warmed by a shabnak-adyr's breath, all blood is required to go back to the earth. Burning bodies is considered sacrilegious, as is the perservation and use of blood in anything except sacrificial rituals. Only an elder has the right to draw blood. In rare, often life-threatening circumstances, an elder may grant another the right to draw blood. However, due to the recent plague, these taboos are now commonly broken.

On occasion, a particularly mischevious shabnak-adyr will inhabit a clay body and explore the world. The clay body has no blood and disintegrates immediately upon receiving a fatal injury. Reports of bloodless, crumbling bodies like that are almost unheard of and doubted even by elders. However, elders do not doubt the existence of shabnak-adyr; they are reportedly able to see and talk to it even when it's not bound to an earthly form.
