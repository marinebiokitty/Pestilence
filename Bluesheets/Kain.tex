\name{\bKain{}}

If you have this sheet, you are a member of the proud and illustrious Kain family. The Kain family is famous among the other spiritually powerful families due to their magical prodigy and innovativeness. However, their unorthodox research often garners suspicion and few members of the Kain family have been elders. Rival families such as the Startsevs and Sidorovs have attempted to steal and replicate the Kains' magical research more than once. You are unsure what happened to these families during the plague.

\cElder{\intro} jealously guards his research into binding earth spirits. No one outside the family knows the true source of \cElder{\their} powers, for the enslavement of an earth spirit would be considered dangerous and cruel by other families.

 \cRebel{\intro} has also made forays into magical research. \cRebel{\They} studies blood magic in hopes of finding a spirit-independent method of healing. The use of blood independent of the earth is normally considered taboo, so \cRebel{\they} has kept her research heavily guarded as well. Unfortunately, \cRebel{\their} notes on blood magic haven't been seen since the shelter was established. Blood magic can be used to harm as well as heal, so it is imperative that the notes do not remain in the wrong hands.
