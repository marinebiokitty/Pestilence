\name{\bFrith{}}

The Frith are a peaceful race of expansionist spacefarers. After a period of rapid colonization, they now occupy the space between humans and Ver, as well as a significant portion of the galaxy. They share borders with many other species, which has helped them to become experienced negotiators. They also take great care to maintain friendly relations on each of their numerous fronts. The Frith were primarily responsible for negotiation between the humans, the Ver, and themselves, establishing regulations about which laws apply in each of their sovereign territories. For the most part, the three species have agreed that the local laws of inhabited space must be observed, regardless of the national origin of the vessel.
	
Frith are mostly humanoid in appearance. However, since they originated from a jungle planet dominated by predators with piercing horns and tusks, they evolved chitinous plating in certain areas to protect vital organs. Their blood is more like an insect's hemolymph than mammalian blood, and as such, tastes disgusting to the Ver.

Frith are born into a rigid caste system, and ruled by a hierarchical matriarchy. They strongly believe in order and the rule of law. However, when dealing with criminals, they prefer rehabilitation and reintegration over incarceration, seeing aberrant behavior as a problem to be solved, rather than mercilessly punished.

- Frith, with their sprawling empire and far-ranging travels, have come across artifacts/followers/relics/fallen civilizations implicating Yog'Sothoth and have outlawed anything to do with it.
