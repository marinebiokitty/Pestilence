\name{\gWoo{}}

You wish to Woo \cJulie{}. You want to further prove your love for \cJulie{them}. To do this you have two ideas in mind.

One, you could write a poem and recite it to the one you love in private.
Two, you could craft a necklace and present it to the one you love in private.

To do the former, craft a poem about the one you love following the following rule set.

A love poem has twelve lines total divided into 3 stanzas with the following rhyme scheme:

ABBA CDCD ACDB

To do the latter, gather the following items and spend 1 minute putting them together into a necklace:

- \iWires{}
- \iGlassLens{} 

When you have done this, destroy the item card for the \iGlassLens{} and cross out the name on the \iWires{} card and write in "Beautiful Necklace."
