\name{\gBelief{}}

You have a belief score, starting at 0. It increases by 1 every time you witness a supernatural phenomenon or accept a supernatural explanation without vocally challenging it. You may choose not to increase your belief score if someone else provides a plausible scientific explanation for the phenomenon you witnessed. A high belief score might give you some insight to the supernatural, but it might not be too good for your sanity.

{\bf Example 1:} You hear someone blaming the plague on an alien invasion. You can either remain quiet and increase your belief score, or explain that hemorrhagic fevers are usually caused by a virus, not aliens. If you choose to do the latter, your belief score will not increase.

{\bf Example 2:} You see a tree turn into a horrifying six-legged green creature. A friend of yours says that the tree produces hallucinogenic spores. You can either dismiss the explanation as implausible and increase your belief score, or accept the explanation and let your belief score remain unchanged. You cannot challenge so direct of an evidence by yourself.

{\bf Repetition:} The same supernatural feat cannot increase your belief score twice. If you saw a rock floating in the air once and increased your belief score because of that, seeing another floating rock will do nothing for you.
