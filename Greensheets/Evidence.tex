\name{\gEvidence{}}

You have a camera, which lets you make recordings. Recordings are either pictures of objects, or videos of people doing things. The camera can store up to 3 recordings at a time. If it is full, you must delete (destroy) a recording before starting a new one. 
	
\begin{enum}[Creating recordings]
    \item With one hand, make a circle and hold it up to your eye, as if looking through a telescope. Tell anyone who looks at you that you are holding up a camera.
    \item Look through the circle at either an object, or someone doing something, for a silent, interruptible five count. The activity or object must be recorded for the entire five count.
    \item If you recorded an object, write the object number on a blank recording card.
    \item If you recorded an activity, ask the player(s) out of game to show you the front of the ability card for what they were doing. Write the character name(s) and ability number on a blank recording card.
\end{enum}
    
Your police cruiser has a terminal, which can be used to make evidence reports.

  	\begin{enum}[Reporting evidence]
      \item Upload a recording with an audible, interruptible 15-count.
      \item Look up the item or activity number on the attached sheet. Place the recording in the indicated evidence category container. Follow any additional instructions. Try not to read instructions for other numbers.
      \item Resolve any instructions on the evidence category container.
    \end{enum}

(\cCgood{} only) You know that any ability or object whose tens digit is odd is illegal in Frith space.
