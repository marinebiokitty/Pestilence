If you have this sheet, it means you know the process for turning a human into a Ver. This process is long and dangerous, so most are quite hesitant to attempt it.

The first three days of the process are fairly simple. On each of the first three nights:

{\bf Step 1:} First, the human must be drained of all but one unit of their blood. The Ver may drink the blood or save it in vessels. It does not matter. 

{\bf Step 2:} Next use a blood collection kit to siphon five units of Ver blood into test tubes or other vessels.

{\bf Step 3:} Have the human drink each test tube of Ver blood, with at least one minute in between consuming each. Rip up the item card for the vessel of blood after the human drinks it.

The final day of the process is more difficult.

{\bf Step 4:} Get a blood test to determine whether the human's blood contains the V factor. It is critical that this test is done before proceeding. This is a kludge.

{\bf Step 5:} Repeat steps 1-3. Be careful! The outcome will become clear after the human drinks the final vessel of Ver blood, and this outcome is dependent on the time during which the final vessel is consumed.

{\bf Step 6:} Roll a d20. Refer to the information below for the result:

If the final vessel of blood is consumed before:

t + 1 hour:



t + 2 hours:



t + 3 hours:



t + 4 hours:
