If you have this sheet that means you know how an officer is appointed into the service of the Ver while in Space. 

The following steps must be followed:

The Ranking Officer on board must provide a sample of blood. Symbolizing the blood an officer must be willing to shed in the name of his crew.
The Crewmember to be Appointed must provide a sample of blood. Symbolizing the blood a crewmember must be willing to shed in the name of the captain
The two samples are intermingled and a bit is drank by each, symbolizing blood given and received
Then the Officer leads the crewmember in the following oath:

I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Empire of the Ver against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. In the name of the Empress may it be.
