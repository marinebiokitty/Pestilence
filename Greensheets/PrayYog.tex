If you have this sheet, then you have the knowledge of how to pray to and beseech Yug Sothoth.

The one leading the prayer must have a sample of blood from any who are participating in the prayer collected in some \iTesttube{}.
The leader of the prayer must then recite aloud the following:

\textit{Yug-Sothoth knows the gate. 

Yug-Sothoth is the gate. 

Yug-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. 

Past, present, future, all are one in Yug-Sothoth.}

Upon completing the chant destroy the blood samples. 

Thus the prayer is completed successfully.

Any effects requiring a prayer to Yug Sothoth to activate are thus activated.
