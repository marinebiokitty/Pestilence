If you have this sheet, then you have the knowledge of how to pray to and beseech Yug Sothoth.

The one leading the prayer must have a sample of blood from any who are participating in the prayer (who must also stay within one zoc while the ritual occurs) collected in some  \iTestTube{}.
The leader of the prayer must lead the others in reciting the following:

\bigquote{Yug-Sothoth knows the gate. 
	
	Yug-Sothoth is the gate. 
	
	Yug-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. 
	
	Past, present, future, all are one in Yug-Sothoth.}

Upon completing the chant destroy the blood samples. Thus the prayer is completed successfully. Any effects requiring a prayer to Yug Sothoth to activate are thus activated.
