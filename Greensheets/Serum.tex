\name{\gSerum{}}

If you have this sheet, it means you know how to make a serum that hides hybrid human/Ver nature from turning up on blood tests. You can pass on this knowledge verbally if you wish to teach another person how to do it.

In order to make the serum, you must have a working centrifuge, a source of electricity, an empty test tube or other vessel, a test tube or other vessel of Ver blood, a test tube or other vessel of human blood, and a test tube or other vessel of Chemical V.

{\bf Step 1:} First, take all of the ingredients and the empty test tube and do an interruptible 20-count to represent mixing the ingredients together and putting the resulting mixture into the empty test tube. When you are done, destroy the item cards of the test tubes of blood and Chemical V.

{\bf Step 2:} Write "red liquid" on the item card for the empty test tube. At this point the red liquid has no useful properties. Drinking it does nothing.

{\bf Step 3:} Make sure your centrifuge is within two feet of a labeled source of electricity. Then do an interruptible 20-count to represent using the centrifuge on the test tube of red liquid and applying an electrical charge to it.

{\bf Step 4:} Destroy the card that says "red liquid" and go get a \iSerum{} card from the out of game X packet.
