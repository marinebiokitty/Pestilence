There are multiple ways to feed on a human or ghoul's blood.

One can feed on blood from a human or ghoul at any time if they are willing. This requires a 3 count which is interruptible.

One can also obtain blood from a human or ghoul who is helpless, unconscious, or restrained. This requires an interruptible 10 count.
