If you have this sheet you know how to test blood for a V factor. In order to analyze the blood you have collected you must take the blood to the \sBloodAnalyzer{} within the \pBioLabC{}. 
Once the blood has been inserted conduct a 15 count (note this is interruptible.) 

To determine whether the blood is positive for the V factor, roll a d6.

{\bf Results:}

1-3: Negative for V factor

4-6: Positive for V factor

Then write "V+" or "V-" on the \iTestTube{} of blood, depending on whether it is positive or negative for V factor. This is in-game information. You cannot intentionally write the wrong result. This is a kludge.
