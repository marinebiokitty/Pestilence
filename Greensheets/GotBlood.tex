There are multiple ways to obtain someone's blood, for whatever reason you may have for blood. 
However all methods require something to put the blood in, namely a \iTesttube{} 

One can obtain blood from someone at any time if they are willing. This requires a 3 count which is interruptible.

One can also obtain blood from someone who is helpless, unconscious, or restrained. This requires a 10 count.
