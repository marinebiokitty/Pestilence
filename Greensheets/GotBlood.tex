There are multiple ways to obtain a human or ghoul's blood, for whatever reason you may have for blood. 
However all methods require something to put the blood in, namely a \iTestTube{}. 

One can obtain blood from a human or ghoul at any time if they are willing. This requires a 3 count which is interruptible.

One can also obtain blood from a human or ghoul who is helpless, unconscious, or restrained. This requires an interruptible 10 count.

If you desire to obtain from the Frith, it must be obtained willingly. This requires an interruptible 10 count.

Upon success, write down on the \iTestTube{} the name of the person + "blood."
