If you have this sheet, it means that you know how to make holy water. Note that this only will work if you have a faith score of 2 or higher.

In order to make holy water, first you must have a test tube or some other vessel. Find a source of water and stand there for a 10-count to fill it. Cross out the name of the vessel on its item card and write "test tube of water" (or whatever vessel it happens to be.)

Next, you must incant each number of an interruptible 20-count to represent saying a prayer over the water. Then cross out the name on the item card and write "holy water."
