If you have this sheet, it means you know how to turn a human into a ghoul. The process is actually very simple. 

If the human is willing, drain your blood into a vessel and have them drink the blood. For the purposes of ghoul making, drinking will take an interruptible 10-count. Then the drinker becomes a ghoul!

If the human is unwilling, make sure they are restrained, but not unconscious. To force them to drink the blood, it will take an interruptible 20-count. Then the drinker becomes a ghoul!

Note that forcibly turning someone into a ghoul is a crime in Frith space. If someone catches you, you must show them your ability card that shows them what you are doing.

Tell the new ghoul (out of game) that their $\gamma$ score is now 4.
