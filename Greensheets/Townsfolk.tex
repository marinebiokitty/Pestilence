\name{\gTownsfolk{}}

The PCs are not the only ones in the shelter. Various townsfolk are also gathered throughout the shelter, represented by sheets on the wall. They are too fatigued to defend themselves or notice the PCs' actions. They are so traumatized by their losses and so hateful of the town healers for failing them that they will refuse to give blood or consent to any experimentation. You can murder each other in plain sight of all the NPCs, and none of them will care enough to notice or intervene.

Townsfolk can be infected, cured or killed. To infect a townsperson, simply place a sticker on their sheet. This sticker can be removed only if the townsperson is cured through an ability. Townsfolk generally distrust medicinal cures due to rumors of fake medicine being sold in the streets.

To kill an townsperson, put your hand on their sheet and start a 10-count interruptible killing blow, as you would with a PC. Unless you are explicitly unable to attack, you can kill a townsperson regardless of how low your CR is. Once you've killed a townsperson, draw a large, noticeable X on their sheet.
