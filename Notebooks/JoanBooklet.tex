\begin{page}{first}

For centuries you have believed that you are serving your just punishment in Hell, but your recent vision of the Archangel St. Michael has brought this into question. You believe that you may be able to determine whether this vision was a hellish trick or a true vision. If you encounter a similar vision, you believe that if you present it with holy water blessed in the name of the Lord, it will reveal its true nature.

Make holy water, and then turn to page \nbref{second}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}

You have successfully made holy water, but you don't know when or if you'll have another similar vision to test. But perhaps there are ways to make it more likely for such a vision to occur. Perhaps you have to prove that you deserve to receive such a vision.
