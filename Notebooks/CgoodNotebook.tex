\begin{page}{first}

You've finally graduated from the Academy and been handed your first assignment: border patrol! Today is your first day, and you've been looking forward to it your whole life. You made sure to get a full's night's rest, your boots are shined, and your uniform is pressed. You're eager to learn everything you can about how to be the best police officer you can!

Talk to \cCbad{}, get \cCbad{his} backstory, and ask for \cCbad{his} advice on how to be a great police officer. Then open page \nbref{second}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}

This being your first day on the job, you're not sure why there's an ex-con piloting your ship. 

Ask \cPilot{} about \cPilot{his} situation, \cPilot{his} backstory, and the crime for which he was convicted. Then open page \nbref{third}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}

It's always a good idea to be prepared. Arm yourself from the weapons locker aboard the \emph{Anodyne}.

Once docking has been completed, open page \nbref{fourth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}

You've never been on a Ver ship before. Look around and meet the crew. If you notice objects or activities that might be illegal, be sure to record them.

Once you've created at least one recording, open page \nbref{fifth}.

Once you've spoken to a Ver for at least two minutes, open page \nbref{sixth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}

You've only read about evidence terminals, and never actually used one. But the best way to learn is by doing!

Upload at least one recording using the terminal aboard the \emph {Anodyne}. Then open page \nbref{seventh}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{sixth}

Well, that seemed suspicious. What exactly are the Ver up to? And did you see a {\bf human} onboard? What are they doing here??

Talk to at least three humans for at least two minutes each, then open page \nbref{eighth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{seventh}

Alarm bells are going off in your head. Something's not quite right on this ship, and you've caught the first hint of it. But you can't quite prove anything yet. You need more evidence.

Once you've uploaded enough evidence for one of the evidence types to read "Proof of...", open page \nbref{eighth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{eighth}

There's definitely illegal activity taking place aboard \emph {TIS Chivalry}. In times of crisis, it is the prerogative of a Frith police officer to defend the innocent and assist the needy.

If you see any kind of combat, try to stop it. You can try to threaten them by recording them, although combat in and of itself is not admissible as evidence. Once you've done so, open page \nbref{ninth}.

Try to help someone whom you perceive as law-abiding. Once you've done so, open page \nbref{tenth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{ninth}

Things are getting out of hand. Provide first aid to someone. Once you've done so, open page \nbref{eleventh}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{tenth}


The glowing vision of Saint Michael appears to you! You feel overwhelmed by feelings of love and righteous fervor washing over you. At first you don't think of it, but then you pull out your holy water and say "I sanctify this place in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." The vision does not flee, but stays there, smiling at you. In your head, you hear the words, "You have done well in this place of cleansing," and then St. Michael fades from view. 

You are in purgatory, and heaven will one day be your reward!

Your CR is +1 for the next ten minutes.

At 15 minutes from end of game (or immediately if there are less than 15 minutes left in game), turn to and open page \nbref{eleventh}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{eleventh}

You hear a chorus of angels singing and a bright white light from above shines on you! Your very skin glows from the inside out!

Put on a blue headband and explain to nearby people (out of game) what they see and hear. Do this for one minute. During this time you are immune to all attacks.

In a blinding flash you disappear as you are taken bodily into Heaven!
