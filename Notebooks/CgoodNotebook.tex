\begin{page}{first}

You've finally graduated from the Academy and been handed your first assignment: border patrol! Today is your first day, and you've been looking forward to it your whole life. You made sure to get a full's night's rest, your boots are shined, and your uniform is pressed. You're eager to learn everything you can about how to be the best police officer you can!

Talk to \cCbad{}, get \cCbad{his} backstory, and ask for \cCbad{his} advice on how to be a great police officer. Then open page \nbref{second}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}

This being your first day on the job, you're not sure why there's an ex-con piloting your ship. 

Ask \cPilot{} about \cPilot{his} situation, \cPilot{his} backstory, and the crime for which he was convicted. Then open page \nbref{third}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}

It's always a good idea to be prepared. Arm yourself from the weapons locker aboard the \emph{Anodyne}.

Once docking has been completed, open page \nbref{fourth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}

You've never been on a Ver ship before. Look around and meet the crew. If you notice objects or activities that might be illegal, be sure to record them.

Once you've created at least one recording, open page \nbref{fifth}.

Once you've spoken to a Ver for at least two minutes, open page \nbref{sixth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}

You've only read about evidence terminals, and never actually used one. But the best way to learn is by doing!

Upload at least one recording using the terminal aboard the \emph {Anodyne}. Then open page \nbref{seventh}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{sixth}

Well, that seemed suspicious. What exactly are the Ver up to? And did you see a {\bf human} onboard? What are they doing here??

Talk to at least three humans (or ghouls) for at least two minutes each, then open page \nbref{eighth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{seventh}

Alarm bells are going off in your head. Something's not quite right on this ship, and you've caught the first hint of it. But you can't quite prove anything yet. You need more evidence.

Once you've uploaded enough evidence for one of the evidence types to read "Proof of...", open page \nbref{eighth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{eighth}

There's definitely illegal activity taking place aboard \emph {TIS Chivalry}. In times of crisis, it is the prerogative of a Frith police officer to defend the innocent and assist the needy.

If you see any kind of combat, try to stop it. You can try to threaten combatants by recording them (although combat in and of itself is not admissible as evidence, {\bf they} don't need to know that). Once you've done so, open page \nbref{ninth}.

Try to help someone whom you perceive as law-abiding accomplish something important to them. Once you've done so, open page \nbref{tenth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{ninth}

Things are getting out of hand. Provide first aid to someone in need of it. Once you've done so, open page \nbref{tenth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{tenth}

You're certainly having an eventful first day on the job. You just hope you're performing to the best of your abilities and remembering your training.

If pages 1-10 are all open, turn to and open page \nbref{eleventh}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{eleventh}

Congratulations, officer. You've done a lot of good work today. When this is all over, assuming you make it out alive, you're sure to be commended for bravery in the line of duty. And all on your first day, too!

Your newfound confidence grants you +1 CR (both offensive and defensive) for the rest of the game.
